## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r }
library(foreign)
library(ggplot2)
library(car)
library(tidyverse)
data <- MS_data_all_years_regs
timber <- MS_data_all_years_regs_timber
Data$st_louis_fed
Data$num_products
```

Data Cleaning
```{r}
Data_2 <- Data %>% filter(total_output_value < 5000) 

```

## Including Plots
```{r}
Data$fed_area <- ifelse(Data$st_louis_fed == 1, c("St_Louis"), c("Atlanta"))

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
coplot(log_total_output_value ~ censusyear | fed_area, type = "l", data = Data)
scatterplot(log_total_output_value ~ censusyear | fed_area, smooth = T, reg.lines = F, data = Data)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
